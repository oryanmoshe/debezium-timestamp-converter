# Debezium Timestamp Converter
This is a custom converter to use with debezium (using their SPI, introduced in version 1.1)  
You can use it to convert all temporal data types (in all databases) into a specified format you choose.

## Usage
You can either download the `.jar` file from the [releases](https://github.com/oryanmoshe/debezium-timestamp-converter/releases) and include it in your connector's folder, or add the converter as a dependency to your maven project.

**You have to add this converter to each of your connectors, not just in the main folder (`/kafka/connect`)!**

## Configuration
### Basic Configuration
To configure this converter all you need to do is add the following lines to your connector configuration:
```json
"converters": "timestampConverter",
"timestampConverter.type": "oryanmoshe.kafka.connect.util.TimestampConverter"
```

### Additional Configuration
There are a few configuration settings you can add, here are their default values:
```json
"timestampConverter.format.time": "HH:mm:ss.SSS",
"timestampConverter.format.date": "yyyy-MM-dd",
"timestampConverter.format.datetime": "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'",
"timestampConverter.debug": "false"
```
